NAME
     mygrep â€“ retrieves lines with patterns

SYNOPSIS
     mygrep [-ciln] PATTERN [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
     The mygrep utility searches any given input files, selecting lines that match one or more patterns.  By default, a pattern matches an input line if
     the regular expression (RE) in the pattern matches the input line without its trailing newline.  An empty expression matches every line.  Each
     input line that matches at least one of the patterns is written to the standard output.

     The following options are available:

     -c  Only a count of selected lines is written to standard output.

     -i  Perform case insensitive matching.  By default, mygrep is case sensitive.

     -l  Only the names of files containing selected lines are written to standard output.

     -n  Each output line is preceded by its relative line number in the file, starting at line 1.  The line number counter is reset for each file
         processed.
