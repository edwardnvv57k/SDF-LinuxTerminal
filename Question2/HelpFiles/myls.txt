NAME
     myls – list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
     myls [directory] [-altr]

DESCRIPTION
     For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, myls displays its name as well as any requested, associated information.  For each
     operand that names a file of type directory, myls displays the names of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, associated
     information.

     If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are displayed.  If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are
     displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted separately and in lexicographical order.

     The following options are available:

     -a  Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (‘.’).

     -l  List files in the long format.

     -t  Sort by descending time modified (most recently modified first).

     -r  Reverse the order of the sort.
