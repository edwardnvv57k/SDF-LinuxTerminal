NAME
     mycp – copy files

SYNOPSIS
     mycp [-fi | -n] [-v] source_file target_file
     mycp [-fi | -n] [-v] source_file ... target_directory

DESCRIPTION
     In the first synopsis form, the mycp utility copies the contents of the source_file to the target_file.  In the second synopsis form, the contents of
     each named source_file is copied to the destination target_directory.  The names of the files themselves are not changed.  If mycp detects an attempt
     to copy a file to itself, the copy will fail.

     The following options are available:

     -f  If the destination file cannot be opened, remove it and create a new file, without prompting for confirmation regardless of its permissions.
         (The -f option overrides any previous -n option.)

     -i  Cause mycp to write a prompt to the standard error output before copying a file that would overwrite an existing file.  If the response from
         the standard input begins with the character ‘y’ or ‘Y’, the file copy is attempted.  (The -i option overrides any previous -n option.)

     -n  Do not overwrite an existing file.  (The -n option overrides any previous -f or -i options.)

     -v  Cause mycp to be verbose, showing files as they are copied.
